# Mini cloud system

A full stack project made with Angular and Spring Boot, that simulates a mini cloud network with users and their machines. Each users has permissions for CRUD operations of the machines as well as other users. A user can start, stop and restart their machines in real time, which takes 5-15 seconds (fake time until the machine "starts" or "stops"). The project was made for a final exam of the "Advanced Web Development" course in my university
